            <p>
                In the Philippines, the root cause of why there
                are so many stray dogs is that majority of pet
                owners still allow their dogs to roam the streets.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many stray dogs are also former pets who have 
                been abandoned by their owners.
            </p>

            <p>
                But dogs dont't belong in the streets which are 
                very unsafe for them. Stray dogs suffer from 
                hunger and disease, are exposed to the 
                elements, and are in constant danger from being 
                run over or abused. Like people, every animal
                deserves a home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Help curb pet homelessness! Always keep your 
                dogs inside your house or yard, have them
                sprayed or neutured, and be prepared to take care
                of them  for thier entire lives.

      <h1>About PAWCHIATO</h1>
      <p>Pawchiato Center is a non-profit organization founded in 2020 with the mission of giving stray and abandoned dogs a second chance at life.</p>
      <p>At Pawchiato Center, everyone has a story. Some of the dogs/cats we rescue have survived abandonment, abuse, or illness. Others are simply lost and scared. But no matter their past, we believe each one deserves a chance at a better future. We provide shelter, medical care, rehabilitation, and most importantly—love. Our team is made up of volunteers, animal lovers, and local vets who all believe in the same thing: "every pet deserves a home."</p>
      <p>Since 2020, we’ve helped hundreds of dogs and cats find their forever families. But our work doesn’t stop there. We also aim to educate the public about responsible pet ownership, encourage spaying and neutering to reduce overpopulation, and create a kinder community for both animals and people. Whether you’re looking to adopt, volunteer, or simply support in your own way—we welcome you into the Pawchiato family. Because together, we can give more animals the second chance they’ve always deserved.</p>
